This application is focused on create a full stack application with react using Next.js 13 as our framework. The featrues will include: create a CRUD app called PostIt, that allows you to share a wee message with the world. We will be using Prisma and Postgresql as our backend with Next auth for creating and auth users.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or

# or
pnpm dev
```
